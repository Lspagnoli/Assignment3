This is a github repository for the purposes of Stevens Institute of Technology - SSW 555 Assignment 3: Practice Refactoring

Goal: Practice refactoring your project user stories by refactoring two instances of bad smells in your code.

To Do:

    Write a user story
    write the Manual test cases (You can use Gherkin language OR Verify that ...)
    write the test cases
    Identify two different bad smells in one or more of your user stories. If your code is already pristine and has no bad smells, then add bad smells that can be refactored.
    Submit your original code (with the bad smells) along with the xUnit (or equivalent) automated test cases to demonstrate that the "smelly" solution works properly.
    Submit a screen dump or text file output showing the automated test results with the "smelly" code.
    Refactor the code to eliminate the bad smells.
    Update your automated test cases to test any problems in your test cases or any new test cases that you added while refactoring and run the automated tests on your refactored code.
    Submit the new code.
    Submit a screen dump or text file output showing the automated test results with the refactored code.

Submit: (In One document)

    User Story
    manual Test Cases with steps
    The original code and automated test cases for the "smelly" code, including two separate examples of bad smells along with a screen dump showing that the automated tests pass with the smelly code.
    The refactored code and automated test cases along with a screen dump showing that the automated tests pass with the refactored code.
